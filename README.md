Adventures in GitHub
==

This React web app allows you to explore the GitHub public API.

#### Check it out [here](https://react-scratch-uk.firebaseapp.com/)

This app was built from scratch following Tyler McGinnis's [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) course.

The components related to _Followers_ are my additionâ€”basically an extension of the tutorial app built t0 practice the lessons of the course. _Battle_ and _Famous_ were built during the tutorial following McGinnis.

I've done quite a bit of refactoring to introduce:
* ES6 syntax
* responsive rendering
* BEM conventions
* [PostCSS-cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) syntax

I've also developed the visual design and UI from the [tutorial app](https://rt-react-fundamentals.firebaseapp.com/).

Thanks to [Tyler McGinnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis) for the great course and [Alex Da Corte](http://alexdacorte.com/) for having an inspiring portfolio site.
