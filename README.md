Adventures in GitHub
==

This React web app allows you to explore the GitHub public API.

This app in this repo was built from scratch following Tyler McGinnis's [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) course.

The _Followers_ components are my original additionâ€”basically an extension of the tutorial app. _Battle_ and _Famous_ were built during the tutorial guided by McGinnis.

For my part, I've refactored the app into ES6 syntax and made it responsive, while also developing the visual design and UI.

The app is live at https://react-scratch-uk.firebaseapp.com/

Thanks to Ryan McGinnis for the great tutorial and [Alex Da Corte](http://alexdacorte.com/) for having an inspiring portfolio site.
