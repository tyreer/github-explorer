My goal with this project was to build something of my own with the tools Tyler McGinnis introduces in his [React Fundamentals](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals/) course.

_Followers_ is what I came up with—a new feature that picks up where the tutorial left off.
I’ve also introduced some big modifications to the [original tutorial code](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals/), including
* ES6 syntax
* responsive rendering
* BEM conventions
* [PostCSS-cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) syntax
* A file structure oriented around reusable components
* An overhaul in visual design and UI from the [tutorial rendition of the app](https://rt-react-fundamentals.firebaseapp.com/)

_Battle_ and _Famous_ were built during the tutorial following McGinnis.

Thanks to [Tyler McGinnis](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis) for the great course (highly recommended!) and [Alex Da Corte](http://alexdacorte.com/) and [Bureau Borsche](http://bureauborsche.com/projects/balenciaga?b=slide) for the Brutalist web design inspiration.
